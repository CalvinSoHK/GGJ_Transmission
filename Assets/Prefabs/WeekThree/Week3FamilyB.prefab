  BODY_TEXT: Hey Lily,NEWLINENEWLINEI know this is hard for you too, but I really
    want to see you again before it happens. It's been hard on all of us. We should
    be together as a family. I want you to see me off...NEWLINENEWLINEIn case you
    don't end up replying, I just want to say I'll always be watching over you and
    I love you so very much. Don't abandon your brother, he makes the dumbest mistakes
    and falls for the worst girls. Spend some more time with your dad, he's so listless
    now he's retired.NEWLINENEWLINEI love you,NEWLINEMom
