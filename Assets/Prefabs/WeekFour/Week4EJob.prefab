  BODY_TEXT: Dear Ms. Tsai,NEWLINENEWLINE Due to your comportment during the last
    few weeks, we must let you go. Your inability to answer important company emails
    in a timely manner was the leading cause for your termination. Furthermore, your
    attitude towards me, your employer, was far from exemplary. You could have had
    a fruitful career if you listened to what I said more carefully.NEWLINENEWLINE
    Best of Luck,NEWLINE Joseph Bates
