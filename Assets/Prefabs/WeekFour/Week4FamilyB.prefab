  SUBJECT: Missed you at the picnic.
  BODY_IMG: {fileID: 0}
  BODY_TEXT: Dear Lily,NEWLINENEWLINEWe had a great picnic in Central Park, reminiscing
    about you and your brother when you were young. Do you remember when we used to
    bake cookies before your father came home? Your brother made such a mess every
    time. At least you turned out a great cook.NEWLINENEWLINEThis is probably the
    last time I'll get to talk to you. I love you so much Lily. I'm so sorry for ruining
    our relationship over such a trivial thing. Regardless of who you are with I know
    you'll make their lives so much brighter, just like as you did with mine.NEWLINENEWLINEI
    love you,NEWLINENEWLINEMom
