  BODY_TEXT: Dear Lily,NEWLINENEWLINEIt's a real shame that you and Mary are apart,
    but I believe it'll be for the better. You didn't suit each other too much.NEWLINENEWLINEI'm
    sorry for not being honest last time, but the real reason I'm emailing you is
    I recently discovered I have stage 4 breast cancer... It was around Christmas
    that I passed out at home. Afterwards your father rushed me to the hospital and
    they gave us the bad news.NEWLINENEWLINEDon't be mad at your father or Barry,
    I told them I would tell you myself. I didn't want them to take on that burden.NEWLINENEWLINEAll
    my love,NEWLINEMom
